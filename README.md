# Budgy

## Introduction

A simple budgeting app that makes use of the ["envelope" strategy](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-envelope-budgeting-1293682) for personal
budgeting. 
> A total budget is comprised of sub-budgets, termed `envelopes`. The name
> `envelope` comes from the historical use of physical currency, which the
> budget-maker would alot to various labeled envelopes, labeled with an alotted
> purpose. The budget-maker would then spend directly from the envelope,
> emphasizing the smaller sub-budget balance at each purchase and forcing
> them to confront budget overruns for sub-budget items mid-period.
